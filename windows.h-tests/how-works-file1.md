}------------------------------Text describes how works age-excepts&instructs.cpp------------------------------{
 

Code asks you to enter your age, after that it detects the answer by try() and catch():
if answer is 0 - it returns Error number 2;
if answer is higher than 120 - it returns Error number 0;
if answer is lower than 0 - it returns Error number 1;
if answer is another symbol or it was not declared in it - it returns Error number 3;

After all program asks user for further action with options:
'Space' to exit from program;
'Backspace' to reload code;
'Shift'(it does not depend on side, you can use Right Shift and Left Shift equally) to watch error codes;
'Ctrl'(it does not depend on side, you can use Right Ctrl and Left Ctrl equally) to clear a console window;
